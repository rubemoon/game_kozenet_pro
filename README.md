## Why This Project?

I have decided to challenge myself by building this project and documenting each step on social media. The repository will remain public so others can learn from my journey. This project aims to be a useful tool for universities, academic weeks, workshops, and presentations that need interaction and engagement.

- **Programmer's Dashboard**: Explore a custom dashboard I designed for programmers at [Dashboard Template](https://www.kozenetpro.com/l/fullstack).
